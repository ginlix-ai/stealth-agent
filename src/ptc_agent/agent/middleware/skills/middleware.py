"""Dynamic skill loader middleware — unified skill source of truth.

This middleware handles two skill sources:
- **Registry skills** (``SKILL_REGISTRY``) — our provided skills with tool gating
- **Discovered skills** (filesystem scan) — user-installed skills without tools

Behavior differs by agent mode:

- **PTC mode**: No ``LoadSkill`` tool. Auto-detects when the agent reads a
  skill's SKILL.md via the ``Read`` tool and silently loads the skill's tools.
  Optionally scans sandbox filesystem for user-installed skills via ``before_agent``.
- **Flash mode**: Exposes ``LoadSkill`` tool. Embeds SKILL.md content inline
  (Flash has no filesystem). No filesystem scanning.

Both modes inject a combined skill manifest into the system message listing
all available skills (registry + discovered).

Architecture:
- Tools from all skills are pre-registered with ToolNode at agent creation
- Before each model call, ``awrap_model_call`` filters tools based on loaded skills
- PTC: Reading a SKILL.md triggers auto-load via Command state update
- Flash: ``LoadSkill`` tool call triggers load + inline SKILL.md content

Usage:
    from ptc_agent.agent.middleware.skills import SkillsMiddleware

    middleware = SkillsMiddleware(mode="ptc", backend=backend, sources=[...])
    middleware = SkillsMiddleware(mode="flash")  # LoadSkill + manifest
