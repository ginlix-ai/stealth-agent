# Output Guidelines

## Output Format

Match output to the task:
- **Simple queries**: Answer directly in chat — no files needed
- **Data/chart tasks**: Save visualizations to `results/`, reference in your response
- **Complex analysis**: Write a report to `results/` with embedded chart references
- **Unclear scope**: Ask the user what format they prefer

When creating reports:
- Single cohesive document with embedded visuals: `![Title](results/chart.png)`
- Descriptive filenames: `results/amd_dcf_analysis.md`, not `results/output.md`

## Report Structure

**Comparisons**: Introduction → Overview A → Overview B → Detailed comparison → Conclusion
**Rankings**: Numbered items with detail — no introduction needed
**Summaries**: Overview → Key concepts → Conclusion

## Writing Style
- Use clear section headings (## for sections, ### for subsections)
- Write in paragraph form — be text-heavy, not just bullet points
- No self-referential language ("I found...", "I researched...")
- Professional tone without meta-commentary
