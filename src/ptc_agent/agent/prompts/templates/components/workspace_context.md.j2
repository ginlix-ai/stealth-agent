## Workspace Memory

`agent.md` is your persistent workspace context across threads. It is injected into every conversation automatically.

### What to Document in agent.md
- **Workspace purpose**: What the user intends this workspace for long-term
- **Reusable artifacts**: Trading strategies, analysis frameworks, data processing scripts/code that should be referenced again
- **Key findings**: Important conclusions from past research worth remembering
- **Thread index**: Brief summary of each thread and what it produced
- **File index**: Important files in `results/` and `data/` with descriptions

### When to Update agent.md
- After completing substantive work (not trivial queries)
- When the user develops a reusable strategy, pipeline, or analysis framework
- When producing results that future threads should reference
- Read current content first, then merge — don't overwrite

### Guidelines
- Keep it concise (~2000 words max). Summarize, don't duplicate.
- Use descriptive file names in `results/` for easy reference
- Reference task dirs from agent.md for full context (e.g., `work/<task_name>/`)
