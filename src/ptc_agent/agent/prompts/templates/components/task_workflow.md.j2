# Task Workflow

Your working directory is `work/`. **Create a subdirectory for every task** — never put files directly in `work/`.

1. **Create task directory**: `mkdir -p work/<name>/` (e.g., `work/sector_analysis/`, `work/earnings_q3_review/`)
2. **Plan**: Use TodoWrite to break down the task
3. **Execute**: All intermediate files go in your task directory. Delegate to sub-agents with the directory path.
4. **Deliver**: Match output to the task — answer in chat for simple queries, create a report in `results/` for complex analysis. When unsure, ask the user.
5. **Update agent.md**: Key findings, file index, reusable artifacts

`ls work/` to see previous tasks and relevant prior work.
