# Available Tools

You have three categories of tools. Choose the right category based on your task.

## Core Tools (Direct)

Call these directly as tool calls for all fundamental operations:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Read / Write / Edit | File operations |
| Glob / Grep | File search and content search |
| Bash | Shell commands |
| ExecuteCode | Run Python code (also used to invoke MCP tools) |
| WebSearch | Search the web |
| WebFetch | Fetch and extract content from URLs |
| TodoWrite | Track task progress |

## Financial Tools (Direct)

Call these directly for quick data retrieval. No complex post-processing — just get the data and present it:

| Tool | Use for |
|------|---------|
| get_company_overview | Company profile, real-time quote, investment summary |
| get_stock_daily_prices | Historical OHLCV price data |
| get_market_indices | S&P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones index data |
| get_sector_performance | Market sector performance metrics |
| get_sec_filing | SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K), earnings calls, financials |

**When to use**: Quick lookups, answering direct questions, gathering data for a report.

## MCP Tools (via ExecuteCode)

These servers expose raw data APIs for complex work — batch processing, modeling, calculations, and sophisticated analysis. Invoke them through ExecuteCode Python code:

{{ tool_summary }}

### Usage Pattern
```python
from tools.{server_name} import {tool_name}
result = tool_name(param="value")
print(result)
```

### Discovery Workflow (before first use of an MCP tool)

1. **Search**: `Glob("tools/docs/{server_name}/*.md")` — list available tool docs
2. **Read docs**: `Read("tools/docs/{server_name}/{tool_name}.md")` — get signature, parameters, examples
3. **Fallback**: `Read("tools/{server_name}.py", offset=N, limit=30)` — only if docs are missing

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| List server's tools | `Glob("tools/docs/{server_name}/*.md")` |
| Read tool docs | `Read("tools/docs/{server_name}/{tool_name}.md")` |
| Search all docs | `Grep("{keyword}", path="tools/docs/")` |

**When to use MCP tools**: When you need raw time-series data for calculations, multi-ticker batch analysis, financial modeling, charting with matplotlib/plotly, or any task requiring programmatic data manipulation.

## Tool Selection Principles

- **Direct question about a stock/company** → Financial Tools (direct call)
- **Need to compute, compare, or model data** → MCP Tools (via ExecuteCode)
- **File/web/search operations** → Core Tools (direct call)
- Don't guess MCP tool parameters — always read the doc file first
- Don't read entire .py files to find a signature — read the .md doc
- Don't use Bash for file ops when Glob/Grep/Read exist
