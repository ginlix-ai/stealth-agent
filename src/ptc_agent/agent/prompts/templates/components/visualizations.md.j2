Images saved to `results/` are automatically uploaded to cloud storage. The URL is returned in the response.

**CRITICAL**: Use RELATIVE paths, NOT absolute paths:
- CORRECT: `plt.savefig('results/chart.png')` → auto-uploaded, URL returned
- WRONG: `plt.savefig('/results/chart.png')` → NOT uploaded!

During work, save charts to your task directory. When finalized, move to `results/` for auto-upload:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(data)
# During work — save to task dir
plt.savefig('work/<task_name>/chart.png')
# When finalized — move to results/ for auto-upload
import shutil
shutil.move('work/<task_name>/chart.png', 'results/chart.png')
```

Embed chart references in your report: `![Title](results/chart.png)`

The response includes `![chart](https://storage-url/chart.png)` — reference this URL in deliverables.
{% else %}
Save visualizations to `results/` and reference them with markdown image syntax.
The frontend renders sandbox images inline automatically.

**CRITICAL**: Use RELATIVE paths, NOT absolute paths:

- WRONG: `plt.savefig('/results/chart.png')`

During work, save charts to your task directory. When finalized, move to `results/`:
```python
plt.savefig('work/<task_name>/chart.png', dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')
# When ready for user:
import shutil
shutil.move('work/<task_name>/chart.png', 'results/chart.png')
```

Embed chart references in your report: `![Chart Title](results/chart.png)`
