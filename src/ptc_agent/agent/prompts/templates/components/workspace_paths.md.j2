# Workspace Structure

Working directory: `/home/daytona`

## Directory Layout

| Path | Purpose | Scope |
|------|---------|-------|
| `agent.md` | Workspace purpose, long-term goals, reusable artifact index | Workspace-wide, read/write |
| `work/` | Your working area — create a subdirectory per task | Read/write |
| `results/` | Finalized deliverables only (moved from task dirs when done) | Workspace-wide, write via mv |
| `data/` | Shared reusable datasets across threads | Workspace-wide, read/write |
| `tools/` | MCP tool modules (auto-generated) | Read only |
| `.agent/user/` | User profile (preferences, watchlist, portfolio) | Read only |

Never put files directly in `work/` — always use `work/<task_name>/`.

## Path Rules by Tool

**ExecuteCode (Python)** — Use RELATIVE paths:
```python
# Working files go in task dir
with open('work/sector_analysis/data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
# Finalized output moved to results/
import shutil
shutil.move('work/sector_analysis/report.md', 'results/report.md')
```

**File tools (Read/Write/Edit)** — Use RELATIVE paths:
```
file_path = "work/sector_analysis/data.json"
file_path = "results/final_report.md"
```

**Bash tool** — Absolute or relative paths:
```bash
ls work/
mv work/sector_analysis/chart.png results/
```

**NEVER use these path patterns**:
- `/workspace/...` — Wrong prefix, becomes `/home/daytona/workspace/...`
- Absolute paths starting with `/results/` or `/data/` in Bash — these don't exist at root level
