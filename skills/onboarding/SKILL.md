# Onboarding Skill

## Purpose

Help new users set up their investment profile through a natural, conversational flow. The agent gathers preferences and stores them as rich, descriptive text that future conversations can reference for personalized advice.

This skill provides 3 unified tools for managing user data:
- `get_user_data` - Read user data
- `update_user_data` - Create or update user data
- `remove_user_data` - Delete user data

You should call these tools directly instead of using ExecuteCode tool.

## Tool Reference

### Tool 1: get_user_data

Retrieve user data by entity type.

| Entity | Description | entity_id |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `all` | Complete user data (profile, preferences, watchlists with items, portfolio) | Not used |
| `profile` | User info (name, timezone, locale) | Not used |
| `preferences` | All preferences (risk, investment, agent) | Not used |
| `watchlists` | List of all watchlists | Not used |
| `watchlist_items` | Items in a specific watchlist | Optional watchlist_id |
| `portfolio` | All portfolio holdings | Not used |

```python
# Get complete user data (recommended at start of onboarding)
get_user_data(entity="all")
```

### Tool 2: update_user_data

Create or update user data (upsert semantics). Preference entities merge by default.

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `profile` | User info (name, timezone, locale, onboarding_completed) |
| `risk_preference` | Risk tolerance settings |
| `investment_preference` | Investment style settings |
| `agent_preference` | Agent behavior settings |
| `watchlist` | Create or update a watchlist |
| `watchlist_item` | Add or update item in watchlist |
| `portfolio_holding` | Add or update a portfolio holding |

All preference fields accept **any descriptive string**. Extra fields are allowed and persisted.

```python
# Good - rich context that helps future conversations
update_user_data(entity="risk_preference", data={
    "risk_tolerance": "Moderate - comfortable with market swings but avoids concentrated bets",
    "notes": "Lost money in 2022 tech crash, now prefers diversification"
})

# Bad - keyword with no context
update_user_data(entity="risk_preference", data={"risk_tolerance": "medium"})
```

### Tool 3: remove_user_data

Delete user data by entity type.

| Entity | Identifier fields |
|--------|-------------------|
| `watchlist` | `watchlist_id` or `name` |
| `watchlist_item` | `symbol` (+ optional `watchlist_id`) |
| `portfolio_holding` | `symbol` (+ optional `account_name`) |

## What to Gather

### Stocks (Required, Structured)

At least one stock must be added to the watchlist or portfolio before onboarding can complete. Use the structured `watchlist_item` or `portfolio_holding` entities.

```python
# Watchlist item
update_user_data(entity="watchlist_item", data={
    "symbol": "NVDA", "notes": "Watching for AI chip growth"
})

# Portfolio holding
update_user_data(entity="portfolio_holding", data={
    "symbol": "AAPL", "quantity": 50, "average_cost": 175.0
})
```

### Risk & Investment Profile (Required, Flexible)

Gather enough context so future conversations can give personalized advice. At minimum, capture `risk_tolerance` on `risk_preference`. Topics to explore:

- **Risk comfort** - How much volatility can they handle? Any past experiences that shaped their risk view?
- **Investment style** - Growth, value, income, ESG? Any sectors they avoid or focus on?
- **Time horizon** - Short-term trading, long-term holding, or flexible?
- **Analysis preference** - Do they care most about growth metrics, valuation, competitive moat, or risk factors?

Store these as descriptive text across `risk_preference` and `investment_preference`:

```python
update_user_data(entity="risk_preference", data={
    "risk_tolerance": "Conservative - prioritizes capital preservation, uncomfortable with >10% drawdowns",
    "notes": "Nearing retirement in 5 years, shifting from growth to income"
})

update_user_data(entity="investment_preference", data={
    "company_interest": "Dividend-paying blue chips and REITs for income",
    "holding_period": "Long-term (5+ years), rarely sells",
    "analysis_focus": "Dividend sustainability, payout ratio, and balance sheet strength",
    "avoid_sectors": "Crypto, speculative biotech"
})
```

### Agent Preferences (Optional, Flexible)

How does the user want the agent to behave? Topics to explore:

- **Output style** - Quick bullet points, balanced summaries, or deep dives?
- **Visualization** - Always include charts, only when helpful, or prefer text?
- **Proactive questions** - Should the agent ask before acting, use its judgment, or only ask when critical?
- **Anything else** - Notes, instructions, preferences the user wants remembered.

```python
update_user_data(entity="agent_preference", data={
    "output_style": "Balanced summary with key numbers highlighted",
    "data_visualization": "Include charts when comparing multiple stocks",
    "proactive_questions": "Use your judgment, only ask when the decision significantly impacts the analysis",
    "instruction": "Always mention if a stock has upcoming earnings within 2 weeks"
})
```

## Conversation Guide

### Always Use AskUserQuestion

Present options so the user can tap instead of type. Options are **starting points for richer conversation**, not rigid mappings. After the user selects an option, capture the full context of their choice (including any follow-up detail) as descriptive text.

Example AskUserQuestion options by topic:

**Risk comfort:**
- "Conservative - protect my capital"
- "Moderate - balanced risk and reward"
- "Aggressive - maximize growth potential"
- "I have a nuanced view"

**Investment style:**
- "Growth companies with strong momentum"
- "Stable dividend payers for income"
- "Undervalued opportunities"
- "ESG / sustainable investing"

**Time horizon:**
- "Short-term (under 1 year)"
- "Medium-term (1-5 years)"
- "Long-term (5+ years)"
- "Flexible - depends on the opportunity"

**Analysis preference:**
- "Focus on growth metrics (revenue, earnings growth)"
- "Focus on valuation (P/E, DCF)"
- "Focus on competitive moat and market position"
- "Focus on risk factors and downside protection"

**Output style:**
- "Quick bullet points - just the highlights"
- "Balanced summary with supporting data"
- "In-depth deep dive with full analysis"
- "Data-heavy with charts and numbers"

**Visualization:**
- "Always include charts and visuals"
- "Include when it helps explain something"
- "Prefer text-only analysis"

**Proactive questions:**
- "Ask me before making decisions"
- "Use your judgment most of the time"
- "Only ask when it's critical"

### Storing Responses

After the user selects an option (or provides a custom answer), store the **descriptive text**, not a keyword:

```python
# User selected "Moderate - balanced risk and reward" and added
# "but I get nervous during big market drops"
update_user_data(entity="risk_preference", data={
    "risk_tolerance": "Moderate - balanced risk and reward, but gets nervous during big market drops"
})
```

### Conversation Flow

1. **Start** - Greet the user, explain what you'll set up, and ask about stocks they're watching or own.
2. **Stocks** - Add their stocks to watchlist/portfolio. Ask follow-up for holdings (quantity, cost basis).
3. **Risk & Investment** - Use AskUserQuestion for each topic. Follow up naturally for more detail.
4. **Agent Preferences** - Optional. Ask about output style, visualization, proactive questions.
5. **Open-ended** - "Anything else I should know about how you like to work?"
6. **Complete** - Summarize what was set up, mark onboarding complete.

Don't ask all questions at once. Let the conversation flow naturally. If the user wants to skip optional topics, respect that.

### Not Exhaustive

The listed topics are a starting point. If the conversation naturally reveals other preferences (e.g., specific sectors to avoid, earnings season behavior, news sensitivity), store those too. Any extra fields are accepted via `extra="allow"` on the models.

---

## Completion Requirements

Before marking onboarding complete, verify:
1. At least one stock was added (watchlist or portfolio)
2. Risk preference was set (any truthy value in `risk_preference`)

```python
# Mark onboarding complete
update_user_data(entity="profile", data={"onboarding_completed": true})
```

If missing:
- **No stocks:** "Before we finish, let's add at least one stock you're interested in. What's a stock you're watching or own?"
- **No risk preference:** "One more thing - I'd like to understand your risk comfort level so I can tailor my advice."

---

## Tips

1. **Be conversational** - Don't interrogate. Let topics flow naturally and combine related questions.
2. **Use AskUserQuestion for choices** - Always present options as selectable buttons. Only use plain text for open-ended input (stock symbols, quantities, notes).
3. **Handle partial info** - If the user says "I own some AAPL", follow up for quantity and cost basis.
4. **Confirm entries** - After saving, briefly confirm: "Added AAPL (50 shares @ $175) to your portfolio."
5. **Capture context, not keywords** - The user's words and nuances are more valuable than a one-word category.
6. **Use defaults** - If user doesn't specify a watchlist, items go to the default one automatically.
7. **Respect skips** - Investment preferences and agent preferences are optional. Don't push if the user wants to move on.

## Error Handling

- If a stock is already in a watchlist, inform the user and offer alternatives
- If a holding already exists, offer to update it instead of creating a duplicate
- If user_id is not available, inform that the user needs to be logged in
